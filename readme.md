# Neighbourhood Map
This is the project 6 for Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program. It is a single page web application showing several places of interest in the beautiful city - Florence, Italy. It is built based on using several ajax API calls to fetch data from Flicker, Wikipedia, Google Maps and Google Street View. The following picture is the screen shot for this web application.

## App Functionality
- The web app consists of 3 parts: search bar, place list and map area.
- When you load the web app first time, 14 places will be added to the place list, with their corresponding markers showing on the map.
- If you hover over a place name in the place list, its corresponding marker will keep bouncing in the map.
- If you click the a place name in the place list, a drop down menu will show more information about the place, and in the same time the corresponding marker will change color to red, with a streeview window showing up.
- If you click the marker in the map, the corresponding place will also show its dropdown menu.
- The search bar is used to filter the places in real time. For example, if you input "flo" in the search bar, only "Florence Central Station" will remain in the place list, and only its marker will remain in the map.
- This web app is designed in a reponsive manner, and it is compatible to the desktop, tablet and moble.
